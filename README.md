# FO4_Wrld

Fallout 4 1.11.191 next-gen — multiplayer mod (FoM-lite framework).
Solo-dev, evening project. Target: 10-player persistent-world survival MMO.

> **Status (2026-04-27):** ghost player body **animates** in real time —
> ~31 joints (full body chain incl. head + hands) replicated over network
> at 20Hz. Walking / running / idle / sneak / turn / jump pose visible
> end-to-end (peer A moves → peer B's ghost-of-A mirrors). Body+head+hands
> all skin-swapped to shared skel hierarchy. Fingers stay at natural
> rest pose (no joints in render-scene tree → sentinel-skip avoids
> T-pose contagion). 1P sender → V/T-pose stub on ghost (deferred).
>
> **B6 wedge 1 shipped** — **door open/close sync** across peers:
> peer A presses E on a door, peer B sees the same door swing open in real
> time (and vice versa). First true world-state replication beyond the
> player avatar + inventory. Sender hooks engine `Activate worker`
> (`sub_140514180`); receiver re-invokes the same function on its local
> REFR via main-thread queue + `ApplyingRemoteGuard` feedback-loop guard.
> Toggle semantics — both clients converge from the same `world_base`
> save without server-side state tracking.
>
> **M9 wedge 1+2 PoC shipped** — **clothing sync between peers** [video coming
> soon]. Peer A equips Vault Suit / Raider outfit → Peer B sees the same
> clothing on A's ghost body, animated with A's pose. Sender hooks
> `ActorEquipManager::EquipObject/UnequipObject`, receiver walks
> `TESObjectARMO → TESObjectARMA → TESModel` to resolve the 3rd-person NIF
> path, loads the NIF, attaches it to the ghost, and re-binds the armor's
> skin to the shared skel.nif so animation propagates. Path scoring picks
> male 3rd-person variant over 1st-person/female fallbacks. Per-peer
> pending queue handles the boot-time race when ghost spawns after the
> peer's force-equip-cycle. Limitations: armor pieces ON TOP of outfits
> z-fight (no biped slot masking), some NIFs have bind-pose mismatch
> clipping (Vault Suit), Object Modifications (BGSMod) like shoulder
> pads/weapon mods not covered. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Demo

[![FalloutWorld demo on YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qs3dNzXnnko/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs3dNzXnnko)

▶ **[Watch the 90s demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs3dNzXnnko)**

2 clients side-by-side. Movement + full-body animation sync, ground-pickup
replication (peer A picks up an item → peer B sees it disappear from the
world), and live container UI update across peers (peer A deposits items
into a nightstand → peer B's open ContainerMenu reflects the new entries
in real time).

| ↳ **B6.1** Door open/close sync | ✅ done — `sub_140514180` Activate worker hook + dual-agent RE convergence, [30s demo](https://youtu.be/T8wLZmCqjxw), see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) |
| **M9** Equipment sync between peers *(clothing + armor visual replication)* | 🟡 4/6 wedges done + w4 foundation — clothing + body cull + OMOD-driven ARMA tier work end-to-end, weapon visibility on ghost in PoC quality, true BGSMod weapon mods + material variants pending |
| ↳ **M9.w1** Equip event detection + broadcast (sender hook OBSERVE-only) | ✅ done — `ActorEquipManager::EquipObject/UnequipObject` detour, EQUIP_OP/EQUIP_BCAST opcodes (protocol v6), [video coming soon] |
| ↳ **M9.w2** Receiver-side NIF resolution + ghost attach + animation | ✅ done — TESObjectARMO struct walk, gender-aware path scoring (M3rd preferred over F/1stP), OMOD-driven priority extracted from `BGSObjectInstance.extra+0x56` and shipped via wire (proto v10) so ghost picks the correct ARMA tier (Lite/Mid/Heavy). Engine helper `sub_1404626A0` PrioritySelect algorithm reimplemented receiver-side. TTD-confirmed 2026-05-03. |
| ↳ **M9.w3** Biped slot masking (hide ghost body parts under armor) | ✅ done — `TESObjectARMO+0x1E8` bipedSlots bitmask, slot-3 BODY mask flips `NIAV_FLAG_APP_CULLED` on ghost's `BaseMaleBody:0` BSSubIndexTriShape (cached at body inject via vtable RVA `0x2697D40` walker). Body hidden under Vault Suit / Power Armor / Synth Armor — no more z-fight. |
| ↳ **M9.w4** Object Modification (BGSMod) sync — shoulder pads, weapon mods, paint variants | 🟡 foundation done in v0.4.0 — wire protocol v9 + mesh-blob pipeline + ghost-weapon state machine + smart NIF resolution. Pistols/melee/launchers visible on ghost as STOCK base. Modded firearms still render as base (no compensator/scope/etc. visible); heavily-modded rifles show one sub-component only. True mod replication blocked on full BSVertexDesc RE — deferred to v0.5+ |
| ↳ **M9.w5** Peer rejoin equipment-state push | ✅ done in v0.3.1 — PEER_JOIN trigger re-arms equip cycle (DONE→ARMED state transition), 1500ms delay, current outfit re-broadcast to newly-joined peer |
| ↳ **M9.w6** Material swap variants (rusty/clean raider, paint jobs) | ⏳ — RE BSMaterialDB swap path used by `nsInventory3DManager::*MaterialSwap*Task` |
| ↳ **B6.2** Lights toggle sync (lamps, lanterns, generators) | ⏳ — same Activate worker pattern as doors, formType filter on `0x20` LIGH |
| ↳ **B6.3** Locks state sync (lockpicked → unlocked cross-client) | ⏳ — REFR lock extra-data + `OnLockedClick` callback hook |
| ↳ **B6.4** Terminals state sync (hacked / unlocked) | ⏳ — TerminalMenu activation event + persisted "hacked" flag |
| ↳ **B6.5** NPC actor pos + pose sync | ⏳ — extend POSE_BROADCAST to remote actors with authority-per-NPC model. The big one — turns "co-op chat in same world" into "actual multiplayer game" |
| ↳ **B6.6** NPC combat target + aggro sync | ⏳ — RE `CombatController::SetTarget`, broadcast NPC→target so observers see "raider shoots peer A" not "raider shoots air" |
| ↳ **B6.7** NPC dialogue state + faction joined | ⏳ — quest-stage adjacent; brainstorm §3.2 says 10 players = 1 entity, simplifies state |
| ↳ **B6.8** Companion state (recruited / position) | ⏳ — companions are NPCs with extra ownership flag |
| ↳ **B6.9** Cell-cleared status (no respawn after group clear) | ⏳ — `cleared` flag in cell extra-data, persisted server-side |
| ↳ **B6.10** One-shot loot pickups (bobbleheads, magazines, holotapes, skill books) | ⏳ — single-pickup persistence, partially covered by container `kill` events |
| ↳ **B6.11** Time of day + weather sync | ⏳ — GlobalVar `GameHour` + Sky weather state |
| ↳ **B6.12** Workshop / settlement build state sync | ⏳ — major epic; build/scrap/move workshop refs + furniture |
| **B7** Rust server port | ⏳ |

## Major RE achievements

- **Single-instance bypass** (1-byte binary patch @ RVA `0xC2FB62`) — runs 2 FO4
  instances simultaneously on the same machine. Required for local
  multi-client testing without spinning up a second physical PC. The
  patch flips a NOP-equivalent on the singleton-check branch.
- **`apply_materials` walker discovery** (`sub_140255BA0`) — the missing step
  for `.bgsm` material resolution after standalone NIF load. Documented in
  `re/stradaB_pink_body_solution.txt`.
- **NIF loader public API** (`sub_1417B3E90`) — bypasses the broken cache
  wrapper that hangs with naive args.
- **Scene graph integration** — depth occlusion, lighting, shadows free via
  `BSFadeNode` attachment to `ShadowSceneNode`.
- **BSSkin::Instance layout fully RE'd** — `bones_fb` at `+0x10`,
  `bones_pri` at `+0x28`, `boneData` at `+0x40`, `skel_root` at `+0x48`.
  Critical empirical finding via TTD: `bones_pri[i]` is NOT a `NiAVObject**`
  but a **direct pointer-to-matrix cache** (= `bones_fb[i]+0x70`). The GPU
  reads matrices via SRV indirection through this cache. Documented in
  `re/M8P3_skin_instance_dossier.txt`.

## Changelog

Latest 3 patches summarized below. **Full version history in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).**

### M9 v0.4.0 (2026-05-01) — wedge 4 foundation: weapon mesh on ghost (PoC, needs heavy polish) [Video coming soon]

- New protocol v9 message types `MESH_BLOB_OP/BCAST` (chunked mesh
  replication, 1372 B `chunk_data` sized BCAST-safe so server can
  fan-out without re-fragmentation). Sender extracts BSGeometry leaves
  from runtime-assembled weapon via 3-level indirection on
  `BSGeometryStreamHelper` at `clone+0x148`. 22 new pytest cases.
- 300 ms deferred mesh-tx via `FW_MSG_DEFERRED_MESH_TX`/`WM_APP+0x4E`
  worker — beats the race against engine's async weapon assembly post-
  `g_orig_equip` (immediate walker frequently captures empty).
- Receiver unified state machine `ghost_set_weapon(peer, form,
  candidates[])` — single weapon slot per peer, atomic transitions,
  downgrade protection (placeholder NIFs never overwrite proper ones),
  idempotent. All wire receivers (EQUIP_BCAST, MESH_BLOB, UNEQUIP)
  funnel through.
- Smart NIF resolution chain: canonical `Weapons\X\X.bgsm` pick →
  folder-derived canonical (`Weapons\MachineGun\MachineGun.nif` from
  sub-component bgsm paths) → all sub-component bgsm-derived → legacy
  TESModel probe (extended `[0x60..0x180]` range + generic Dummy
  filter).
- ⚠️ **Hard-won PoC, NOT production**. Working: pistols, baton,
  Fat Man, Grognak's Axe, Deathclaw Gauntlet visible on ghost as
  STOCK base. Modded firearms render without mod parts. Heavily-modded
  rifles show only one sub-component (just the barrel for assault
  rifle, just the stock for shotgun). Hunting rifle invisible. True
  mod replication blocked on full BSVertexDesc RE — see [CHANGELOG.md
  ](CHANGELOG.md) "Why this was extremely hard" for the 10-point
  list of engine constraints fought (runtime-assembled weapons with
  no static NIF, async assembly walker race, donor shader vd
  mismatch crashes, server fan-out chunk-overflow, downgrade races,
  cross-form mesh contamination, ...). Tag: `v0.4.0-w4-foundation`.

### M9 wedge 1+2 (2026-04-29) — clothing sync between peers [Video coming soon]

- Sender hooks `ActorEquipManager::EquipObject/UnequipObject` (`sub_140CE5900`
  / `sub_140CE5DA0`), filters local-player only, broadcasts `EQUIP_OP`
  with `{item_form_id, kind, slot_form_id, count}`. Protocol bumped to v6.
- Receiver walks `TESObjectARMO+0x2A8` addon array → `TESObjectARMA`
  → embedded `TESModel` → BSFixedString path. Score-based offset probing
  picks male 3rd-person variant over `_F.nif` female / `1stPerson` arms-only.
- Loads NIF via `g_r.nif_load_by_path` + POSTPROC for material/texture
  resolution → `attach_child_direct` to ghost root → `skin_rebind::
  swap_skin_bones_to_skeleton` re-binds armor's `bones_fb[i]` from inert
  NIF stub bones to ghost's animated `skel.nif` joints → animation
  propagates from `pose-rx` to armor mesh.
- Per-peer FIFO pending queue handles boot-time race: when peer's force-
  equip-cycle broadcast arrives before ghost is spawned, ops are queued
  and drained on next `inject_debug_cube` success.
- Live-tested: peer A equips Vault Suit (`0x1EED7`) / Raider Underarmor
  (`0x18E3F7`) → peer B's ghost-of-A wears + animates with same outfit.
  Bidirectional. PoC; armor pieces over outfits z-fight (no biped slot
  masking yet), BGSMod attachments not covered, A-first-B-later case
  open. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### B8 (2026-04-28) — force-equip-cycle on game start ⚠️ workaround

- Three days of equip-related crashes resolved by exercising the player's
  `BipedAnim` through `ActorEquipManager` once before any peer connects.
  Worker fires 10s post-`LoadGame`: posts `WM_APP+0x4A` to unequip
  Vault Suit, waits 2s for biped rebuild to settle, posts `WM_APP+0x4B`
  to re-equip → `BipedAnim` allocator state normalizes from semi-allocated
  pool refs to fully heap-owned → M8P3 ghost binding latches onto stable
  pointers and equip changes post-peer-connect no longer dangle.
- Tag: `v0.2.1-equip-stable`.
- ⚠️ Band-aid, not architectural fix. Hardcoded to Vault Suit `0x1EED7`;
  saves without it silently no-op. Proper fix is independent ghost
  `skeleton.nif` (Option C). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Why this exists

I've been waiting ~10 years for someone to ship Fallout 4 multiplayer.
Existing efforts I'm aware of:

- **Fallout Together** — abandoned 2020, never reached stable bone
  replication.
- **F4MP** — paused / no animation system in the public state I last saw.
- **Skyrim Together** (predecessor for SkyrimSE) — got working but with
  desync issues that informed several of the architecture choices here.

This project takes a different architectural bet: **native scene-graph
injection** (BSFadeNode → ShadowSceneNode) plus per-bone joint
replication via the engine's own `UpdateDownwardPass` propagation,
instead of reimplementing skinning from scratch. We let the engine do
the heavy lifting (skin upload, GPU constant buffers, lighting, shadows
when fixed) and feed it joint matrices via memory writes that match
exactly what its anim graph would produce.

Whether this scales cleanly to 10 peers is an open question — current
testing is 2-peer. The RE work for the 1.11.191 next-gen build (skin
pipeline, pointer-cache layout, NIF loader API) is the contribution
that should be most reusable for anyone else attempting the same thing.

## Known limitations

- **Fingers don't articulate** — finger joints exist only in the
  underlying havok skeleton (`.hkx`), not in the rendered scene-graph
  tree we walk. Receiver gets a sentinel quat for them and falls back
  to bind pose (slightly curled fingers, not extended T-pose).
- **1st-person sender → ghost adopts V/T-pose stub** — when the sender
  is in 1P view, the engine animates the alt-tree body to a simplified
  stub pose since the body is invisible to the local camera. Two
  detection heuristics were tried (Pelvis canary, rotation hash); both
  failed because the alt-tree retains all named bones and rotations
  jitter every tick. Proper fix needs `PlayerCamera` singleton RE.
  Workaround: keep the observed peer in 3rd-person.
- **Ghost body has no shadow** — separate render flag investigation,
  deferred.
- **PipBoy animation is broken on the ghost** — when a peer opens their
  PipBoy, the engine plays a 1st-person camera-relative arm-raise anim
  on the local player. The ghost on observers' screens has no equivalent
  3rd-person animation set up (vanilla FO4 doesn't really animate a
  remote player's PipBoy because there are no remote players in
  vanilla), so the ghost's arms freeze / contort during the peer's
  PipBoy session. Cosmetic, doesn't crash. Workaround / future wedge:
  detect peer-PipBoy state and either despawn ghost or play a static
  "looking at PipBoy" placeholder pose.
- **Tested with 2 peers** — multi-peer ghost cache (peer-id keyed
  registry) not yet implemented; 10-peer scaling is theoretical.
- **Network rate-limited to 20Hz** — works smoothly on LAN, untested
  over real-world internet routes; receiver-side interpolation between
  POSE_BROADCAST frames is open work.
- **Modded weapons render as STOCK on ghost** — M9.w4 v0.4.0 ships the
  pipeline (mesh-blob wire + state machine + NIF resolution) but the
  receiver doesn't reconstruct mod parts. Compensator / scope / custom
  barrel / paint variants on a peer's weapon are NOT visible to other
  peers; they see the base weapon NIF only. True mod replication
  blocked on full `BSVertexDesc` RE — needed to rebuild factory-output
  BSTriShapes that the engine's existing shaders accept (donor shader
  cloning crashed in render walk every time during v0.4.0 iteration —
  vd format mismatch). Deferred to v0.5+. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
  "Why this was extremely hard" for the full investigation.
- **Heavily-modded rifles show only ONE sub-component on ghost** —
  assault rifle renders just the barrel; double-barrel shotgun renders
  just the wood stock. The receiver's smart NIF resolution picks the
  first loadable candidate from the wire's bgsm paths; for runtime-
  assembled rifles that's a sub-component (`MachineGunBarrelLong01.nif`)
  rather than an assembled weapon (the latter doesn't exist as a static
  NIF — it's composed at `EquipObject` time from N sub-NIFs).
- **Hunting Rifle invisible on ghost** — neither the canonical bgsm
  pick nor the folder-derived heuristic
  (`Weapons\HuntingRifle\HuntingRifle.nif`) finds a loadable NIF; falls
  back to `RecieverDummy.nif` placeholder (empty NIF). Likely needs a
  hard-coded path table or a different resolution strategy.
- **Cross-form mesh contamination** — walker on the sender sometimes
  captures bgsm paths from a PREVIOUSLY-equipped weapon still residing
  in the player's bipedAnim subtree (observed: assault rifle equip
  captures hunting rifle `308Casings` bgsm paths). Receiver gets
  contaminated candidate list; usually still loads correctly thanks to
  the multi-candidate try-each fallback, but path resolution is brittle.
