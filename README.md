# FO4_Wrld

Fallout 4 1.11.191 next-gen — multiplayer mod (FoM-lite framework).
Solo-dev, evening project. Target: 10-player persistent-world survival MMO.

> **Status (2026-04-26):** ghost player body **animates** in real time —
> 31 of ~70 joints replicated over network at 5Hz. Walking / running pose
> visible end-to-end (peer A moves → peer B's ghost-of-A mirrors). Hands
> (fingers), helpers, AnimObjects pending Step 2.

## Major RE achievements

- **Single-instance bypass** (1-byte binary patch @ RVA `0xC2FB62`) — runs 2 FO4
  instances simultaneously on same machine. Killer of Fallout Together + F4MP.
- **`apply_materials` walker discovery** (`sub_140255BA0`) — the missing step
  for `.bgsm` material resolution after standalone NIF load. Documented in
  `re/stradaB_pink_body_solution.txt`.
- **NIF loader public API** (`sub_1417B3E90`) — bypasses the broken cache
  wrapper that hangs with naive args.
- **Scene graph integration** — depth occlusion, lighting, shadows free via
  `BSFadeNode` attachment to `ShadowSceneNode`.
- **BSSkin::Instance layout fully RE'd** — `bones_fb` at `+0x10`,
  `bones_pri` at `+0x28`, `boneData` at `+0x40`, `skel_root` at `+0x48`.
  Critical empirical finding via TTD: `bones_pri[i]` is NOT a `NiAVObject**`
  but a **direct pointer-to-matrix cache** (= `bones_fb[i]+0x70`). The GPU
  reads matrices via SRV indirection through this cache. Documented in
  `re/M8P3_skin_instance_dossier.txt`.

## Changelog

### M8P3 — Pose replication over network (2026-04-26)

First end-to-end animation replication: peer A's body movement triggers
peer B's ghost-of-A to mirror in real time.

**Pipeline (per frame, 5Hz network rate):**
1. Sender (peer A) reads local PC's joint `m_kLocal` rotations.
2. 3x3 → quaternion → packed in `POSE_STATE` payload (~1KB).
3. Server fan-outs to other peers as `POSE_BROADCAST`.
4. Receiver (peer B) writes received quaternions into ghost skel
   joint `m_kLocal`.
5. Engine `UpdateDownwardPass` propagates rotations through the
   skeleton hierarchy → skin anchors inherit → GPU draws animated body.

**RE deliverables:**
- `re/M8P3_skin_instance_dossier.txt` — full BSSkin::Instance layout
- `re/M8P3_skin_walker_dossier.txt` — `NiAVObject::UpdateWorldData` chain
- `re/M8P3_skin_update_pass_AGENT_*.txt` — dual-agent investigation of
  the GPU upload pipeline (concluded: pull-based via SRV, no flat buffer)

**Code deliverables:**
- `fw_native/src/native/skin_rebind.{cpp,h}` — bones_fb swap +
  bones_pri re-cache (critical for GPU to read swapped matrices)
- `fw_native/src/native/scene_inject.cpp` — `on_bone_tick_message`
  (sender, 20Hz tick / 5Hz broadcast) + `on_pose_apply_message`
  (receiver, main-thread)
- `fw_native/src/net/protocol.h` + `net/protocol.py` —
  `MessageType::POSE_STATE` / `POSE_BROADCAST` (variable-length
  quaternion payloads, max 80 bones × 16B)
- `net/server/main.py` — `_handle_pose_state` fan-out

**Bugs squashed during M8P3 (in chronological order — for posterity):**
1. `get_bone_by_name("LArm_ForeArm1_skin")` returned NULL because cached
   skel had only `_skin`-stripped names (false at the time, see #6).
2. Skel cache had duplicate name entries; `find_node_by_name` first-match
   diverged from the swap walker's match for the same name.
3. `swap_for_geometry` modified only `bones_fb`, not `bones_pri`. GPU
   reads `bones_pri` → kept reading stale stub matrices.
4. `bones_pri[i]` was assumed to be `NiAVObject*` array — it's actually
   a pointer-cache to bone+0x70 (matrix data). Confirmed via TTD.
5. Test cycle matrix translation formula was wrong (was
   `T(joint)·R·T(-joint)` for pure-rotate-around-joint, but the bone's
   m_kWorld translation should stay at joint position regardless).
6. Bind orientation was lost when overriding world matrix with pure
   `R_y` — replaced with `R_y(angle) × engine's_3x3` to preserve.
7. Translation feedback loop: tick handler read `bone+0xA0` to compose
   override translation, but our hook had just overwritten that field
   → translation frozen at first-tick value → forearm pinned at spawn
   while body translated. Solved by hook applying 3x3 delta only;
   translation always taken from engine's just-written m_kWorld.
8. Sender + receiver sorted bone trees alphabetically and indexed
   positionally — but the trees had **different content** (local PC
   render scene vs ghost skin). Fixed via canonical name list cached
   from skel.nif (joints only, `_skin` anchors filtered out).
9. `bones_fb` is missing intermediate joints (only `_skin` anchors for
   forearms etc.). Refactored canonical to walk skel.nif directly,
   filter `_skin`, keep all 80+ joints.

**Diagnostic tools added:**
- TTD (Time Travel Debugging via WinDbg Preview) — recorded a 10GB
  trace of FO4 to confirm `bones_pri[i]` layout via memory inspection.
  Setup at `ttd_attach.bat` (run as admin while game is alive).
- 7 Frida scripts for runtime memory diff, pose probe, skin buffer
  hunt, etc. Under `frida/14_*.js`–`20_*.js`.

**Open work (next milestones):**
- Step 4: replicate fingers (30 bones missing in current canonical
  because they live deeper in skel.nif than the local PC walk reaches).
- Step 5: bump network rate from 5Hz → 20Hz; add receiver-side
  interpolation for visual smoothness.
- Step 6: multi-peer ghost cache (registry per peer_id).

## How to build (developer notes)

Required:
- Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 (`E:\BuildTools\` assumed by `build.bat`)
- CMake ≥ 3.25
- Ninja (bundled with VS Build Tools)
- Python 3.12 (for launcher + server)
- Frida 17+ (for live RE traces)

Build native DLL:
```
cd fw_native
build.bat       # produces build/dxgi.dll
deploy.bat      # copies to Side A + Side B game dirs
```

Run multiplayer (after deploy):
```
launcher/start_A.bat
launcher/start_B.bat
```
